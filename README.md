# Dog vs. Cat Image Recognition
- This project is a machine learning program that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network and a supervised learning solution to trained a model to recognize the difference between a dog and a cat when taking a random photo (of a dog/cat) from the internet.

### Dataset Information
- This project pulls its dataset from the [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats) dataset from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). This dataset is what's used to train the model to recognize the pattern differences from thousands of different cat and dog images. Then, a separate directory of randomly scattered dog and cat images are used to test the model to verify its accuracy.

### Tools and Environment
- This project was built using Anaconda Python as well as in the Jupyter Notebook IDE on my local machine. Many different open-source python modules were utilized to build this program, such as Tensorflow, Pandas, and NumPy, just to name a few.
